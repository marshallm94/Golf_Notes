## Swing Thoughts

**"Down the Line" Club Plane Differences:**
* The angle between your forearm and the shaft of the club should become smaller as you move from shorter clubs to
  longer clubs; *adjust your grip accordingly.*
* The angle between the swing plane and your torso plane *should vary* as you move from shorter clubs to longer clubs.
* The angle between the swing plane and your torso *can feel like < 90 degrees* for longer clubs (e.g. 5 iron and
  longer).
* If you are consistently hitting it fat with longer clubs, *it could just be that you need to move the bar further away
  from you and flatten the swing plane.*

### Birds Eye View - Swing Plane

**Different Ball Position == Different Shot Shapes**
* "Bend it a lot in order to learn out to bend it a little"
    * Consider the red part of the swing plane the "No Fly" zone
